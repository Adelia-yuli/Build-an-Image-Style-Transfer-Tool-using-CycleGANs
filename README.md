# Transform Photos to Monet Paintings with CycleGANs

Artists like Claude Monet are recognized for the unique styles of their works, such as the unique colour scheme and brush strokes. These are hard to be imitated by normal people, and even for professional painters, it will not be easy to produce a painting whose style is Monet-esque. However, thanks to the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their many variations, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can build and train deep learning models to bring an artist's peculiar style to your photos.

## Objectives
After completing this project you will be able to:

- Describe the novelty about CycleGANs
- Understand Cycle Consistency Loss
- Describe the complicated architecture of a CycleGAN
- Gain good practices of training deep learning models
- Implement a pre-trained CycleGAN for image style transfer
## Setup
For this project, we will be using the following libraries:

- numpy for mathematical operations.
- Pillow for image processing functions.
- tensorflow for machine learning and neural network 
- related functions.
- matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
